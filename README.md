# Logistic Regression Example

This repository contains an example of Logistic Regression using Python, focusing on the Social Network Ads dataset. The goal is to predict whether a user purchased a product based on age, gender, and estimated salary.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is 'Social_Network_Ads.csv'. It includes the following columns:

- Age
- Gender
- Estimated Salary
- Purchased

## Steps

1. **Import necessary libraries:**
   - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.

2. **Load the dataset:**
   - Use Pandas to read the 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' file.

3. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Drop the 'User ID' column.
   - Visualize variables using count plots and kernel density plots.
   - Examine descriptive statistics for 'Purchased' equal to 0 and 1.
   - Convert the categorical variable 'Gender' to dummy variables.
   - Create boxplots for numeric variables 'Age' and 'EstimatedSalary'.
   - Scale numeric variables using Min-Max scaling.

4. **Model Building with Statsmodels:**
   - Define target variable 'y' and features 'x'.
   - Add a constant to the features.
   - Fit a logistic regression model using Statsmodels.

5. **Model Building with Scikit-learn:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Fit a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn.
   - Make predictions on the training and testing sets.

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for both training and testing sets.

## Results

Display the summary of the Statsmodels logistic regression model and print the evaluation metrics for both training and testing sets.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run the Python script. Make sure to have the required libraries installed.
